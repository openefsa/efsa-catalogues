# EFSA Catalogues

> Kindly note that the EFSA API Portal has been discontinued. We are excited to announce that a new portal, powered by cutting-edge technology, will be launched in 2025. In the meantime, if you need to browse EFSA catalogues, you can still do so even if you do not have a DCF account or an OpenAPI token (*instructions provided below*).

This repository contains the latest versions of the catalogue files in *'.ecf'* format (published on a quarterly basis) to be imported in the Catalogue Browser. This is a customised extension released exclusively by EFSA and contains a catalogue in a special format which can be imported in the Catalogue Browser without the need of logging in with a DCF account or an OpenAPI token.

## Import catalogue

Importing a catalogue in *'.ecf'* format into the Catalogue Browser is done by clicking on:

**File** → **Import Catalogue**

*Please note that, before importing a new catalogue, it is necessary to close the current catalogue.*

After clicking on the '**Import Catalogue**' option, a new window appears that allows for the selection of the *'.ecf'* file to import. Click on the '**Open**' button to start the import process. A notification will be displayed when the process is successfully completed.
